# AI Research Notes

Research notes live under `ai/research/` and summarize product, user, and codebase context for a single `task_slug`.

## Conventions

- One research note per task: `ai/research/<task_slug>-research.md`.
- Frontmatter includes `type: ai-research`, `task_slug`, timestamps, and related links.
- Each research note links back to `[[ai/backlog/<task_slug>]]` and forward to the plan and task list.

## Current examples

- [[ai/research/demo-feature-research]]
