# 1. Task Overview

- **Original request:** Smoke test research note for the demo feature.
- **What success looks like:** Clear understanding of the placeholder “demo feature” task and identification of missing details to unblock planning.

# 2. Product & User Context

- Users and flows are unspecified; task appears to be a placeholder/smoke test for process validation.
- No PRD or UX context provided beyond the minimal backlog entry in [[ai/backlog/demo-feature]].

# 3. System & Code Map

No code or architecture snippets were provided. Key references so far:
- Process conventions defined in [[ai/agents/research.prompt]] and the indexes under [[ai/ai-home]].

# 4. Data Model & Invariants

- No domain entities or schemas were shared for this task.

# 5. Existing Behaviors & Workflows

- No implementation details, workflows, or tests are available; the task is currently just a backlog placeholder.

# 6. Risks, Unknowns, and Open Questions

- Unknown product goal and target user.
- No defined UI, API, or data requirements.
- Unclear success criteria beyond acting as a demo/smoke test.

# 7. Recommended Next Steps

- Clarify feature intent: user persona, problem statement, expected outcome, and scope.
- Identify the part of the codebase to inspect once scope is known (UI, API, data).
- Create or locate a PRD/spec and link it from [[ai/backlog/demo-feature]] to unblock deeper research.
