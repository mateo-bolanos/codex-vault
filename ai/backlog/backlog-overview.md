# AI Backlog

Backlog notes live under `ai/backlog/` and are identified by a `task_slug` in their frontmatter.

## How to use

- Create a new task with `codex-vault task create <slug>`.
- Each task note links to its research, plans, workflows, and QA notes.
- Treat the backlog note as the canonical source of truth for a task.

## Example tasks

- [[ai/backlog/demo-feature]]
