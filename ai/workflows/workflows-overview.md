# AI Workflows

Workflow notes live under `ai/workflows/` and capture cross-task, end-to-end user and system flows.

## Conventions

- One primary note per workflow: `ai/workflows/<workflow_slug>.md`.
- Frontmatter uses `type: ai-workflow` and `workflow_slug`.
- Each workflow links to its related tasks under `[[ai/backlog/backlog-overview]]`.
