# AI Runs

Run notes under `ai/runs/` are optional logs of significant AI executions (pipelines, long research runs, etc.).

## Conventions

- File names may include a slug and timestamp, e.g. `ai/runs/<task_slug>-<timestamp>.md`.
- Frontmatter can use `type: ai-run` and include links back to the relevant task and plan.
